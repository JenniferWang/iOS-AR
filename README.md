#TODO:
* Image Marker Tracking:
 * `PlaneTracker` class implementation is not completely done yet.
 * Need to modify the part regarding tracker and detector in `GameViewcontroller.m` and `GLView.m`, or write a wrapper for
  `PlaneTracker`.
* GLView:
 * Implement color coding to check whether the user has tapped on a rendered 3D object. 
* UI:
 * Though I am not a UI designer, it will be fun to make it look better.
